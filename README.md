This Macaulay2 script computes the minimal forbidden graphs for graphs with k trivial critical ideals
Just modify the parameter n in forb3reals.m2 to compute gamma, that is, the number of trivial critical ideals over R
Later, we will use other script to find the minimal forbidden graphs for the graphs with 3 trivial critical ideals over R
